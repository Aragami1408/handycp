# Handy Competitive Programming
A library contains `probably useful` Competitive Programming utilities (`Algorithm`, `Data Structures`).

Sadly, only C++ devs can consoom this. Might create future bindings later.

## What does it contains
* Data structures:
    * Binary Search Tree
    * Linked List
    * Statistics Engine
* Algorithms:
    * Search Algos
    * Sort Algos

## How to use this one exactly?

Will do this later...
